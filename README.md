# Dotfiles

My system configuration. Includes config files for:

* Fish
* Hyper
* VSCode
* Spectacle
* Git

Also includes a bootstrap script to set up a new machine. Not something I use 
often, so it's probably out of date.

## Installation:

```
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/deanacus/dotfiles/master/dotfiles.sh | bash -s
```
