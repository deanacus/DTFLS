# DESCRIPTION:
# Not really a whole lot to it, just a standard .bash_profile
# file. Configures bash the way I want it, and is easy to 
# read and understand. Hopefully.
#
# TODO:
# 1. Set colours so that everything is coloured, not just prompt.

# Should probably show MOTD, but I just really like a clean
# terminal to come home to.
